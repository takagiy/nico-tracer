Watching history analysis on nicovideo.jp

## TODO
* [ ] Ensure an online storage with Google Firebase.
* [ ] Make the browser extension to upload the watching information to the storage.
  * [ ] We should hook some function on the `ended` event of the html5 `<video>` tag.
* [ ] Make a web frontend to display the watching history.
* [ ] Do some data visualization, e.g., top hits for each user in the frontend.
